      <h2> <span> Inspiration </span> </h2>
      <p> I originally found the idea of a planted tank from owning an aquarium when I was younger. I heard of
        the Walstad Method and by extension a dirted and planted tank. With recent use of YouTube shorts, I also found
        an abundance of content showing off planted tanks. When I was researching how I could potentially create a planted tank,
        I found a great page with pictures from an aquascaping contest <a href="https://showcase.aquatic-gardeners.org/2022/index0a.html"> here </a> </p>

    <h2> <span> Vision </span> </h2>
     <p> My initial vision was a fall-themed tank with an assortment of red, yellow, and green plants. This would be accompanied by red and orange
       critters. </p>

     <ul class="a">
       <li> 20 gallon long tank </li>
       <li> 80w LED light strip </li>
       <li> White sugar sand substrate </li>
       <li> Driftwood </li>

      <h2> <span> Where did you get your materials from?  </span> </h2>
      <p> First, I searched for a local fish store (LFS) in Ithaca.
      Unfortunately, the closest ones were in Binghamton or Syracuse, which I wasn't willing to drive to. <br> </br>
      I turned to online alternatives first, opting to buy plants from local etsy users around the world.
      For the tank, I knew that I wanted to purchase second-hand, so I was able to find this on Facebook marketplace.
      I also purchased the driftwood from an online retailer and found the shale stones from a gorge near my apartment.
      I had to purchase all other materials from Petsmart.

    <h2> <span> First Milestone  </span> </h2>
    <h3> <span> Cycling  </span> </h3>
    <p>
      I started this project by repurposing the tank that I purchased second-hand. I removed all of the chunky river rock and poured some potting soil
      into the tank as the first layer. Then, I was able to wet the soil. Normally, this is when you would plant the aquatic plants, however, I messed up
      the order and poured the sand substrate over.

      <br> </br>
      The next step in creating my planted aquarium was cycling the tank. I used some quick start tank material, purchased a snail to help
      create some bioload input, and also fed the snail daily with blanched squash, zucchini, and carrots. At this point, I only had the Anubias
      and Amazon Sword plants in.

    <h3> <span> Planting & Hardscaping  </span> </h3>
    <p>
      The next major step I had to take was planting and hardscaping the tank. Hardscaping refers to putting <thead>
      rocks, driftwood, and other "hard" materials into the tank. I figured that I would do this when my plants arrived,
      however, you are supposed to do this before you fill up your tank with water.

    <h2> <span> Third Milestone  </span> </h2>
    <h3> <span> Maintenance & Replanting  </span> </h3>
    <p>
      After having the tank established, I had to do frequent water changes (weekly/bi-weekly), trim, and replant the stem plants.
      I had hoped that the plants would grow fast enough to give the tank more of a "forest look" and cover up the substrate, however,
      things don't always turn out as planned.

    <p>
      Although it didn't turn out exactly as I had hoped, I had a lot of fun putting together this art project. It was interesting
      to learn about how difficult it can be to craft a cohesive underwater garden. Placing the plants, trimming, and replanting them
      took some time to learn, but it was rewarding to see them grow and flourish.

    <h2> <span> Reflection </span> </h2>
     <p> It wasn't easy trying to learn everything quickly to get the project started ASAP. At the beginning of the project, I
     didn't even know what cycling was. I can confidently say that I was challenged throughout this whole project, by making sure
      this tank didn't implode, but also learning the art of managing an aquarium. I didn't know there was a whole
  cycle involved with fish-keeping that made live plants an essential part of the planted tank. Learning to trim and replant different
    plants was also a challenging but rewarding experience. Overall, it was amazing being able
to design an aquarium and learn all about the work that goes into managing my own underwater garden. I will be keeping this aquarium and seeing how it continues to evolve!</p>
