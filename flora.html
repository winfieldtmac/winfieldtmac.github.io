          <p>
          I grew up and lived in the Las Vegas valley for 19 years before leaving home to attend Cornell University. I am a first generation student and have been surrounded by diverse experiences  my entire life.
          </p>

          <p>
          In Las Vegas, I worked as a tutor for over 2 years and am passionate about education and helping others learn. I'm excited to apply my experiences as a student, designer, and altruist to opportunities in product design, user research, and UX/UI design.
