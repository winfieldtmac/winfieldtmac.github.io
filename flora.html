        <h2> <span> Horicultural Signifiance </span> </h2>
        <p> Aquatic plants are super unique and I enjoyed learning about them. They play an essential role in the nitrogen cycle, uptaking toxic compounds like ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. This keeps the water safe for the fish and other critters in the tank. For my tank plants, I primarily chose stem plants because
        they are good at propogating and grow quickly. I also chose to include moss, anubias, and amazon swords because of their hardiness and tolerance for low light conditions.
