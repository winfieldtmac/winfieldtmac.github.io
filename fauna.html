        I had the pleasure of developing a game called Luce with an amazing team of Cornell students as a designer. Play as a child named Luce, navigating their nightmares and manipulating shadows to banish enemies. I aided in pitching the premise for this stealth and strategy based game along with creating monster and furniture assets. Photoshop and figma were used for most purposes including brainstorming and illustration.

    I looked at Outlook Mail's strengths and weaknesses as a communication platform and explored different avenues to improve user experiences. Conducted user interviews, produced prototypes, and iterated with respect to feedback given by my peers. All work was done using tools such as medium, figma, and notion.<a href=https://winfieldmac.medium.com/outlook-mail-a-more-organized-outlook-1657a3c2c376> Link to Medium article (5 min read). </a>

      Through an internship with the New York State Food Laboratory Division, I got to help their PDP department develop product codes. Originally, employees would have to manually generate product codes using an online tool. However, using some python and data science skills, I was able to automate a generator for these codes. By inputting a search phrase, the program I made would search the database for related items and automatically create the codes.
